                <h1> Active Recall </h1>
                <p>Actively trying to remember information without looking at your notes or the textbook.<br>This strengthens memory and enhances long-term retention.</p>

                <p>It forces your brain to retrieve information, strengthening the neural pathways related to that knowledge.</p>

                <p>After reading a section, close your book and try to recall the main ideas. Flashcards are a popular tool for this method.</p>

                <h1>Feynman Technique</h1>
                <p>Explaining a concept in simple terms as if you were teaching it to someone else.</p>

                <p>By simplifying complex ideas, you reinforce your own understanding and identify gaps in your knowledge.</p>

                <p>Take a concept and try to explain it in plain language. If you struggle, revisit the material and refine your explanation.</p>

                <h1>Interleaved Practice</h1>
                <p> Mixing different topics or subjects in one study session rather than focusing on a single topic.</p>

                <p>This method strengthens problem-solving skills and enhances the ability to apply knowledge in varied contexts.</p>

                <p> Instead of focusing on one subject for hours, switch between subjects or types of problems (e.g., math, history, and science) during a study session.</p>

                <h1>Pomodoro Technique</h1>
                <p>Breaking study sessions into intervals (typically 25 minutes of work followed by a 5-minute break).</p>

                <p>Short, focused bursts of study help maintain attention and prevent burnout.</p>

                <p>Set a timer for 25 minutes, work on a task, then take a 5-minute break. After four "Pomodoros," take a longer break (15-30 minutes).</p>

                <h1>SQ3R Method <br>(Survey, Question, Read, Recite, Review)</h1>
                <p> A systematic approach to reading and retaining information from textbooks or other materials.</p>

                <p> It breaks down the reading process into manageable steps, helping you retain more information.</p>

                <p>How to apply:<br>
                    Survey- Skim the material to get an overview.<br>
                    Question- Turn headings into questions.<br>
                    Read- Read to answer the questions.<br>
                    Recite- Summarize what youâ€™ve learned.<br>
                    Review- Go over the material again later to reinforce your understanding.</p>

                <h1>Mind Mapping</h1>
                <p>Creating visual diagrams that link concepts together, helping you see relationships between ideas.</p>

                <p> It helps you organize information visually, improving both comprehension and recall.</p>

                <p>Use a blank sheet of paper or software tools to create a map with a central idea, branching out into related subtopics.</p>
